# Grouping alerts from a cluster

Author: achvatal

Last updated: 26 Apr

## Goals

Limit the number of alerts from clusters so that a single root problem on a
cluster should only generate a single alert.

## Current state

Every critical alert generates a Pager Duty incident, regardless of timing

## Proposal

Enable time-based alert grouping on Pager Duty services to automatically
merge new incidents into an existing incident (for the same service) if its
most recent alert was within a configurable timeframe (defaulting to one
hour).

This can be configured by adding an `AlertGroupingParameters` parameter to
the Service type where it's created in `pkg/pagerduty/service.go`, this would
affect new clusters. For existing clusters, a check will be added to the
pagerdutyintegration reconcile loop that ensures this setting is configured.
